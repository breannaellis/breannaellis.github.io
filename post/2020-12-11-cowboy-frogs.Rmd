Yeehaw! Look at these two rootin-tootin cowboys! They love Rstudio more than Python but that's just because they're used to Rstudio!! Below is some code in both Rstudio and Python that shows Dr. Woodword that I can get the two languages to talk to each other! It ain't fancy but it works!

```{r setup, include= FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```


```{r}
#R code chunk
hi<-"Hello"
```


```{python}
#python code chunk
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi)#access R-defined objects with r.

```

```{r}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi))#access Python-defined objects with py$
```

```{r}
hist(quakes$mag)
```

```{python}
import re

```

```{r}

```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()
